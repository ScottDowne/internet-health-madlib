## Environment Variables

You can configure the following environment variables:

|Variable|About|
|--------|-----|
| PORT | Port for the app, defaults to 7000, feel free to change this to any 4 digit number.
| APPLICATION_URI | For local dev, this is just http://localhost:7000 unless you changed PORT, which if you did you should update the port here to match.

## Setup

```
$> npm install
$> cp sample.env .env
```
